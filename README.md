# FlaskBook

A Facebook clone purely based on Flask

<b>Note</b>: I started learning Flask and while learning I made this Project its buggy and needs alot of work and features done.


<b>Features</b>:
  1. User-Login and Registration 
  2. Friends (Adding and removing)
  3. Multimedia Support (User can upload Images and Photos)
  4. User Search
  5. Status and Profile Section
  6. And some small features that need not be addressed
  
<b>Future Plans</b>:
  1. Making the UI more comfy and also suitable for mobile devices(currently only desktop users can properly access it)
  2. Email Verification(Function is present in the code just gotta impliment it properly)
  3. User Chats
  4. Some API implimentation to get user data in json format for debugging or testing
  5. Implimenting Ajax(so my pages wont load again and again on specific actions like <b>likes and comments</b>
